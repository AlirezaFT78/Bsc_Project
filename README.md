# Bachelor's Degree Project 
In this repository, I share my codes for the BSc Project. The project aimed to give us experience working on state-of-art papers. In my project, I started by reading a survey about "Transformers in Medical Imaging" which you can [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841523000634) or download [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09873). Then I chose the "Clinical Report Generation" field and started reading "Cross-modal Memory Networks for Radiology Report Generation" which you can download [here](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.459/).
## My Work (Method 1)
After I understood their main idea, I made slight changes to get better results. My idea was to add a second decoder to process the whole report after being generated by the first decoder. I had two different implementations for my idea, and this repository includes the first one. I made changes in main_train.py, modules/att_model.py, base_cmn.py, and caption_model.py.
## Datasets and Pre-Trained Model
The paper uses two datasets (IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR) in their paper but I only use the first one due to access and power of process limits.

For `IU X-Ray`, you can download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c0BXEuDy8Cmm2jfN0YYGkQxFZd2ZIoLg/view?usp=sharing) and then put the files in `data/iu_xray`.

For pre-trained models, you can download the paper's best model [here](https://github.com/zhjohnchan/R2GenCMN/blob/main/data/r2gencmn.md) and then put the file in `data`.
